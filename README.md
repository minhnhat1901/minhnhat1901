### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Web Development and Software Engineering. 
ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any open-source project related to AI. I believe that teamwork can lead to greater results, and I'm eager to contribute to the broader tech community.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything related to C++ because this is one of the programming language that I spend a significant amount of time mastering it.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can shoot me an email at mnhat1901@gmail.com. I may take a couple days to respond.

- âš¡ Fun fact: Vietnam, my travel destination, is home to the world's largest cave, Hang Son Doong, located in Phong Nha-Káº» BÃ ng National Park. The cave is so vast that it could hold an entire 40-story skyscraper inside it! So, in addition to visiting my beloved grandma, my trip would present opportunities to explore rich history, breathtaking landscapes, and delightful cuisine!
